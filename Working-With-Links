Creating Links:
To create a link in HTML you need two things.
1. The name of the file to which you want to link.
2. The text that will server as the clickable link.
The text included within the link tag is actually visible on your page.
When readers click the link the browser loads the URL associated with the link.

# <a href="https://WWW.google.com"> Google </a>
href - Hyper text reference(attribute)
<a> ... </a> - Tag
href attribute to specify the name or URL to which this link points.
<a> tag requires attributes in order to be useful.
<a> tag is also call as "anchor"tag.

# HTML5 made <a> tags with no attributes valid as placeholder links for use with CSS nd Scripts.
